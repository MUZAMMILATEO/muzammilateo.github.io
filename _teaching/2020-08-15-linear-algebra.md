This course introduced the core principles of **Linear Algebra**, forming the mathematical backbone of modern computational methods, machine learning, and computer vision.  
It equipped students with the conceptual and computational tools necessary to work with **vector spaces**, **matrices**, and **linear transformations**.

**Course Highlights**
- Systems of linear equations and **matrix operations**  
- **Determinants**, **rank**, and **inverse matrices**  
- **Vector spaces, basis, and dimension**  
- **Eigenvalues, eigenvectors**, and **diagonalisation**  
- Applications in **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **engineering modelling**

Students completed analytical exercises and implemented matrix operations using **Python (NumPy)** and **MATLAB**, reinforcing theoretical understanding through computation.
