This postgraduate course focused on **advanced principles and algorithms of digital image processing**, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation using **MATLAB** and **Python**.  
It aimed to equip students with the knowledge and tools required for **computer vision, medical imaging, and pattern recognition** research.

**Course Highlights**
- Image enhancement, filtering, and restoration techniques  
- **Edge detection, segmentation, and morphological processing**  
- **Feature extraction** and **texture analysis** for object recognition  
- **Fourier**, **wavelet**, and **multi-resolution** analysis for image representation  
- Applications of image processing in **medical diagnostics** and **industrial inspection**

Students completed laboratory sessions and projects involving **real-world image datasets**, developing both the **analytical intuition** and **practical programming expertise** to tackle complex imaging problems.
