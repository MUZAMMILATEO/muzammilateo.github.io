### üß© Why Segmenting Cancer Tissue Is So Hard

In digital pathology, each **whole-slide image (WSI)** of a biopsy can span several gigapixels ‚Äî far too large for direct deep learning inference.  
To diagnose prostate cancer, pathologists rely on subtle differences in texture and gland morphology that AI models must learn to detect at **micron-level precision**.

Our recent project at the **University of Twente** focuses on this challenge: teaching AI to segment prostate tissue into four key categories, **background**, **stroma**, **benign glands**, and **tumour regions**, directly from *Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)* slides.

### ‚öôÔ∏è The Idea: FCBFormer for Histopathology

We built on [**FCBFormer**](https://github.com/ESandML/FCBFormer), a transformer-based encoder‚Äìdecoder architecture originally designed for polyp segmentation.  
The model fuses convolutional and transformer representations to capture both **local cellular structures** and **global tissue organisation**.

Key design components include:
- A **PVTv2-B3** backbone for multi-scale contextual learning.  
- A **residual convolutional branch** to preserve boundary details.  
- A **prediction head** that merges both to produce a 4-channel segmentation map.

### üßÆ Making Boundaries and Tumours Sharper

Beyond standard **Cross-Entropy** and **Dice Loss**, we introduced new regularisers that explicitly enforce geometric consistency:

- **Soft Boundary Dice Loss** - aligns predicted edges with gland boundaries.  
- **Dilated Dice Loss** - adds tolerance around small, irregular tumour or benign regions to boost recall.

The total objective was defined as:

$$
L_{total} = L_{CE} + L_{Dice} + \lambda_b L_{Boundary} + \lambda_t L_{TumourDilated} + \lambda_g L_{BenignDilated}
$$

with $\lambda_b = \lambda_t = \lambda_g = 0.7$ balancing the terms.

### üß† Training and Evaluation

- **Tiles:** $256 \times 256$ px with 64 px overlap to reduce border artefacts.  
- **Optimiser:** AdamW with adaptive learning rate decay.  
- **Augmentation:** mild rotations, flips, and colour jittering (Albumentations).  
- **Environment:** fully Dockerised with deterministic seeding and automatic checkpointing.

Training ran on a single GPU, logging per-epoch metrics for complete reproducibility.

### üìä Results and Insights

The model achieved a **mean IoU of 0.71** across validation WSIs:

| Class | IoU |
|--------|-----|
| Background | 0.99 |
| Stroma | 0.91 |
| Benign | 0.52 |
| Tumour | 0.40 |

Despite modest tumour performance (limited data and imbalance), the model produced coherent segmentations with strong stroma delineation.

### üß´ Why This Matters

Even partial automation can save pathologists significant time.  
By pre-highlighting suspicious gland regions, such models act as **assistive diagnostic tools**, not replacements.  
The qualitative overlays are especially useful for **annotation bootstrapping**,  speeding up dataset expansion for future supervised learning.

### üöÄ What‚Äôs Next

We plan to extend the framework with:
- **Multi-resolution learning** (low- and high-mag fusion).  
- **Self-supervised pretraining** on unlabelled WSIs.  
- **Multi-instance learning (MIL)** to link patch-level predictions to slide-level outcomes.
