<div style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-word;" markdown="1">

I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **University of Twente**, The Netherlands, specialising in **AI-driven medical imaging** and **computer vision**.  
My work focuses on developing intelligent and interpretable algorithms for **tumour diagnosis**, **3D reconstruction**, and **image-guided surgery** using data from **MRI**, **CT**, **X-ray**, **histopathology**, and **endoscopy**. I completed my **PhD in Computer Vision and Machine Learning**.

I have been involved in several **European research projects** aimed at building **trustworthy and explainable AI systems** for healthcare.

My broader research interests include:
- Medical image analysis and _3D_ reconstruction  
- Explainable and uncertainty-aware AI  
- Multi-modal data fusion and instance learning  
- Visual SLAM and scene understanding for surgical navigation  

I am proficient in **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **Docker**, and **MLflow**, and experienced in building scalable AI pipelines for research and clinical use.  
I have presented my work at more than **ten international conferences** and actively contribute to collaborative projects on **AI for early disease detection**.

Beyond research, I also enjoy **teaching and mentoring** students in **Python programming**, **image processing**, and **machine learning**, and have supervised multiple **Technical Medicine** projects in collaboration with the **Netherlands Cancer Institute** and **Princess Máxima Centre**.

### Collaborations
I have collaborated with clinical and research partners across The Netherlands and Europe, including:
- **Netherlands Cancer Institute – Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (NKI-AVL)**  
- **Princess Máxima Centre for Paediatric Oncology**  
- **Radboud University Medical Centre (Radboud UMC)**  
- **Andros Clinics**  
- **University of Twente - Robotics and Mechatronics (RaM) Group**  
- **European research consortia under Horizon Europe and NWO programmes**

These collaborations have focused on combining **AI**, **robotics**, and **medical imaging** to support **minimally invasive and image-guided surgery**.
