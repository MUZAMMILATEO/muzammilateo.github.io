I have had the privilege of mentoring and supervising several **Technical Medicine (TG)** and **Biomedical Engineering** students from the **University of Twente**, working in collaboration with the **Princess Máxima Centre (PMC)** and the **Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AVL)**.  
My mentoring emphasises **scientific independence**, **reproducible code practices**, and **translational impact**, guiding students from concept formulation and experimental design to clinical validation and dissemination.

### Current & Completed Supervisions

| Student | Level | Period | Topic | Host Institution | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Carmen Kloppenberg** | MSc (TG) | 2025 – ongoing | *Development of spatial computing workflow for paediatric surgical navigation using mixed-reality integration at the PMC* | Princess Máxima Centre / University of Twente | Ongoing |
| **Joris de Vries** | MSc (TG) | 2025 – ongoing | *Spatial computing for paediatric chest-wall tumour localisation: comparative study between HoloLens 2 and Apple Vision Pro* | Princess Máxima Centre / University of Twente | Ongoing |
| **Rick Sijben** | MSc (TG) | 2024 – 2025 | *A standardised workflow for 3D lung models to support thoracic surgery planning using 3D Slicer* | Netherlands Cancer Institute / University of Twente | Completed |
| **Daan van Herwaarden** | MSc (TG) | 2024 - 2025 | *Development of a robust pipeline for 3D segmentation and registration of pulmonary structures for image-guided thoracic surgery* | Netherlands Cancer Institute / University of Twente | Completed |

### Mentoring Scope
- Guidance on **experimental design**, **deep-learning pipelines**, and **3D medical image reconstruction**.  
- Supervision of **code development** in Python (PyTorch, Open3D, 3D Slicer API) with emphasis on reproducibility.  
- Support in **scientific writing**, including abstracts, figures, and journal submissions.  
- Collaborative co-supervision with clinical and engineering mentors at **PMC**, **NKI-AVL**, and **UT**.

### Outcomes
Several projects led to **validated prototypes**, **clinical pilot evaluations**, and **conference presentations**, contributing to the translational objectives of AI-assisted surgical planning and navigation in oncology.

If you are a student interested in pursuing a research internship or thesis within **AI-driven medical imaging, surgical robotics, or computer vision**, you are welcome to contact me at **m.khan@utwente.nl**.
